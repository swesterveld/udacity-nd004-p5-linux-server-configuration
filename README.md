# Project "Conference Organization App"

This is the result I achieved for ***[Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd004) - Project 5: Linux Server Configuration***.
For this project I've taken a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on
a virtual machine and prepared it to host the [Catalog App project](https://github.com/swesterveld/udacity-nd004-p3-item-catalog/)
from earlier in the Nanodegree program.

## Development Environment

For reviewing -- upon graduation form the Nanodegree program -- this project is
running in a development environment. This environment is on an Amazon AWS EC2
instance accessible by the reviewer:
